The PandaCam is a library for use with the PandaCam I2C module. 

Concept
===================================
NTU students are working on a robot to navigate across the lunar surface. The robot is required to 'scan' for minerals. In order to allow this functionality I have created a Pan Tilt Camera to be mounted on the robot.


Module Overview 
====================================
This module contains a motor to pan and a motor to tilt the camera. The camera is a standard analog drone camera mounted in the camera case mounting. Potentiometers on both axis are used to establish position angle of the axis and a work gear is used to provide accurate camera positioning.
